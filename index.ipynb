    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the age of digital communication, social media platforms like Twitter have become instrumental in gauging public opinion. These platforms, rife with real-time reactions, comments, and sentiments, offer a goldmine of data that can be harnessed for various purposes. From businesses seeking to understand consumer preferences to governmental bodies aiming to gauge public sentiment on policies, the applications are manifold. One such significant application is in the realm of legislative decision-making, where understanding public sentiment can lead to more informed and representative decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nyika Analytika, a reknown data analytics company, has embarked on a pioneering project to analyze Twitter sentiments regarding two of the world's leading tech giants: Apple and Google. These companies, with their vast array of products and services, have become household names, eliciting strong opinions from users worldwide. By understanding the sentiments around these brands, it becomes feasible to predict public reactions to any legislative or regulatory changes concerning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya's Parliamentary ICT Committee, responsible for overseeing and formulating policies related to Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recognizes the importance of this endeavor. As the world becomes increasingly digital and interconnected, the actions of major tech companies can have wide-reaching implications. Whether it's about data privacy, product pricing, or any other tech-related issue, understanding public sentiment can guide the committee in its legislative and oversight functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and categorize Twitter sentiments. The ultimate goal is to provide the ICT Committee with actionable insights that reflect the public's views, aiding them in making decisions that are in line with the interests and concerns of the citizenry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the methodology, the dataset sourced from data.world, the challenges faced, and the results of our analysis.

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The arena of modern business is no longer restricted to boardrooms, production lines, or sales pitches. Instead, it thrives on the digital expanse, where real-time conversations, reviews, and sentiments shape the dynamics of brands and industries. At the heart of this digital conversation is social media, with platforms like Twitter becoming the epicenter of brand discussions, user feedback, and public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Power of Public Sentiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment of the masses, especially when expressed freely on platforms like Twitter, carries immense weight. Not only does it reflect the immediate public reaction to products, services, or policies, but it also serves as a predictor of future trends, behaviors, and market shifts. For businesses, understanding this sentiment is crucial for product development, marketing strategies, and reputation management. For governmental bodies, it offers a genuine reflection of the public's pulse on policies, decisions, and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apple and Google: More Than Just Tech Giants**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple and Google, two of the world's most influential tech brands, are more than just businesses. They symbolize a lifestyle, an ethos, and to some extent, ideologies. Their products, ranging from smartphones and software to services like cloud storage and music streaming, touch the lives of billions globally. As such, sentiments around these brands are not merely reflections of product satisfaction; they encapsulate broader themes of privacy, technological advancement, affordability, and societal impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Kenyan Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya, with its burgeoning tech scene and rapidly digitizing economy, represents a significant market for global tech giants. The nation's youth-driven population, increased mobile penetration, and a thriving startup ecosystem, especially in cities like Nairobi, make it a focal point for brands like Apple and Google. As these companies make inroads into the Kenyan market, understanding the local sentiment becomes paramount. Moreover, as Kenya positions itself as a tech hub in East Africa, the decisions made by its Parliamentary ICT Committee can influence not just local, but regional tech dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Legislation and Oversight in the Age of Tech**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world increasingly driven by data, digital privacy, and technological innovations, the role of legislative bodies like Kenya's Parliamentary ICT Committee becomes even more pivotal. Their decisions can shape the trajectory of the nation's digital future, influencing everything from startup growth and foreign tech investments to digital rights and internet freedoms. In making these decisions, the committee must strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring consumer rights, and maintaining security. Herein lies the essence of our project: to provide the committee with a tool that offers insights into public sentiment, aiding in more balanced, representative, and informed decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis: The Bridge Between Brands and Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "By harnessing the power of Natural Language Processing to analyze sentiments around Apple and Google, this project aims to bridge the gap between the public, brands, and policymakers. It's not just about positive or negative feedback on a product. It's about understanding deeper themes of trust, expectations, concerns, and aspirations that people associate with these brands. Such insights can inform not only business strategies for Apple and Google but also guide the ICT Committee in understanding potential public reactions to tech-related legislation and regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business understanding of this project extends beyond mere data analysis. It touches upon the intricate web of interactions between brands, consumers, technological innovations, and legislative frameworks. By delving into the sentiments of Twitter users, Nyika Analytika seeks to offer a comprehensive view of the public's stance on two of the world's most influential tech brands, thereby aiding Kenya's Parliamentary ICT Committee in its noble endeavor of shaping the nation's digital destiny."

    "## Statement of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the digital age, where information flows seamlessly across borders and opinions are voiced in real-time, understanding public sentiment has become paramount for both businesses and governments. The sentiments, often scattered across platforms and buried within vast amounts of textual data, hold valuable insights that can guide decision-making processes. Among the platforms, Twitter stands out as a premier space for consumers, professionals, and enthusiasts to voice their opinions on products, brands, and policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most discussed entities in the tech world are Apple and Google. Their vast product portfolios, ranging from hardware like smartphones and laptops to software solutions and digital services, have garnered them billions of users worldwide.

    "2. Acts as a proactive tool for the ICT Committee, allowing them to anticipate public reactions and adjust their strategies accordingly.\n",
    "3. Bridges the gap between public sentiment and legislative action, ensuring that the policies formulated are in line with the aspirations, concerns, and needs of the citizenry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core problem Nyika Analytika seeks to address is the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of public sentiment on Twitter concerning Apple and Google.

    "\n",
    "**4. Granularity of Sentiment Labels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the granularity of sentiment labels is vital. Basic sentiment analysis might categorize sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. However, more nuanced datasets might provide more granular sentiments like 'very positive', 'somewhat negative', etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Distribution of Sentiments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary understanding of how sentiments are distributed can offer valuable insights. For instance, is there an overwhelming majority of neutral tweets, or is there a balanced distribution of positive and negative sentiments?\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Temporal Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If timestamps are available, understanding the temporal distribution of the data is essential. This can help in identifying trends over time or understanding the impact of specific events or product launches on public sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Brand/Product Specific Information:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the focus is on Apple and Google, it's crucial to identify:\n",
    "- Which products or services are most frequently discussed?\n",
    "- Is the sentiment predominantly positive or negative for specific products?\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Potential Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every dataset presents its unique challenges. For sentiment analysis on tweets, common challenges include:\n",
    "- **Sarcasm**: Tweets may contain sarcasm, which can be challenging for models to interpret correctly.\n",

    "- **Negative emotion**: 570 tweets\n",
    "- **I can't tell**: 156 tweets\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Count Vectorization (Bag of Words)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method represents text as a matrix of token counts. Each row corresponds to a document (in our case, a tweet), and each column corresponds to a unique token in the corpus. The value at a given cell indicates the count of that token in the corresponding document.\n",

    "- **TF-IDF Vectorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method builds on the count vectorization approach but adjusts the counts based on the importance of a token in a document relative to its frequency across all documents. It helps in giving more weight to terms that are more specific to a particular document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",

    "- The \"Positive\" class also has a decent F1-score of 46%.\n",
    "- However, the model failed to correctly classify the \"Negative\" and \"Unknown\" classes.\n",

    "- The F1-score for the \"Positive\" class is 35%.\n",
    "- Similar to Logistic Regression, Random Forest couldn't classify the \"Negative\" and \"Unknown\" classes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: 61%\n",
    "- The SVM's performance is in between the two previous models.\n",
    "- The \"Neutral\" class has a precision of 67% and a recall of 78%.\n",
    "- The F1-score for the \"Positive\" class is 45%.\n",

    "- Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy among the three models, but the difference isn't substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**:\n",
    "1. **Address Class Imbalance**: The models' inability to predict the \"Negative\" and \"Unknown\" classes might be because of their low representation in the dataset. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) can be explored.\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different text vectorization techniques or adding more features (e.g., length of tweet, presence of certain keywords) to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the parameters of the models, especially for Random Forest and SVM, might help in achieving better results.\n",
    "4. **Deep Learning**: For sentiment analysis, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers (like BERT) often outperform traditional machine learning models. If computational resources permit, you can explore these models for better accuracy."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Significance of Sentiment Analysis**: At Nyika Analytika, we recognize the transformative power of sentiment analysis, particularly in today's digital age. Platforms such as Twitter serve as reservoirs of public sentiment, capturing the zeitgeist of the digital populace in real-time. Tapping into these vast repositories can furnish us with a deep understanding of public reactions, a knowledge invaluable to esteemed bodies like the Kenyan Parliamentary ICT Committee. Our dedicated utilization of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques ensures that our methodologies are at the forefront of data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Inference**: The dataset we've meticulously sourced encompasses tweets targeting two of the world's technological behemoths: Apple and Google. Our initial exploration divulged variations in sentiment distributions and highlighted particular brand/product mentions. Furthermore, the presence of missing values in the dataset has accentuated the necessity for a rigorous and thorough data cleansing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Metrics of Our Models**:\n",
    "   - **Logistic Regression**: Our meticulously trained model achieved an accuracy rate of 65%. It showcased commendable prowess in categorizing Neutral sentiments, reflecting an F1-score of 0.76. This indicates a harmonious balance between precision and recall for this specific category. Nevertheless, we acknowledge room for improvement in the categories of Negative and Unknown sentiments.\n",
    "   - **Random Forest**: This model, another jewel in our analytical arsenal, registered an accuracy of 63%. Echoing the Logistic Regression model, it exhibited a pronounced affinity for the Neutral sentiments with an F1-score of 0.75. We are actively seeking to enhance its efficacy for other sentiment categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Cleansing and Refinement**: \n",
    "   - We advocate for the judicious handling of missing values. Their importance will dictate whether imputation or row deletion is the optimal strategy.\n",
    "   - We further recommend the incorporation of advanced text pre-processing techniques, encompassing stemming, lemmatization, and the elimination of special characters, to elevate the caliber of data being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Innovative Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - We suggest delving into avant-garde text vectorization methodologies like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or Doc2Vec. Their ability to encapsulate semantic word relationships can be the linchpin to enhancing model performance.\n",
    "   - Consider the extraction of nuanced features from tweets, such as tweet length, URL presence, or specific hashtag usage, as they might wield untapped predictive prowess.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploring Model Horizons**:\n",
    "   - We propose experimentation with intricate architectures like Neural Networks and ensemble methods. Models imbued with Deep Learning capabilities, such as LSTM or GRU, are renowned for their efficacy in sentiment analysis tasks, given their prowess in discerning textual sequences.\n",
    "   - We also recommend a rigorous phase of hyperparameter fine-tuning for our current models, ensuring they operate at their zenith.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Addressing Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - Our introspection has revealed potential class imbalances. To rectify this, we suggest techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or even the adoption of synthetic data methodologies like SMOTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Augmenting Data Sources**:\n",
    "   - In our quest for a holistic sentiment understanding, we're considering the integration of data from diverse social media platforms and tech forums. This multidimensional approach promises a more comprehensive sentiment landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iterative Feedback Mechanism**:\n",
    "   - We're in the process of instituting a feedback loop where our model's predictions undergo validation against real-world outcomes. This iterative process promises continuous model refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Engaging with Stakeholders**:\n",
    "   - We underscore the importance of continuous dialogue with the Kenyan Parliamentary ICT Committee. This ensures our analytical endeavors remain aligned with their evolving requirements, guaranteeing actionable and pertinent insights.\n",
