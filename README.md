First, I'll inspect the uploaded Jupyter notebook to understand its content. This will allow me to create a relevant README for the GitHub repository based on the notebook's content.

Based on the initial content from the Jupyter notebook, it appears to be a project that performs sentiment analysis on Twitter opinions regarding Apple and Google products. The analysis is intended to aid Kenya's Parliamentary ICT Committee in decision making.

Let's create a README.md structure for this project:
